async function findUser() { ... }: This is an async function named findUser that you can call to look up a GitHub user's information.

let usernameEntered = document.getElementById("username");: It retrieves the input element with the id "username" to get the username entered by the user.

EmptyTables();: This function is called to clear any previous user data from the tables on the page. It's defined later in the code.

const response = await fetch("https://api.github.com/users/" + usernameEntered.value);: This line makes an asynchronous HTTP GET request to the GitHub API using the fetch function to retrieve information about the specified GitHub user.

const user = await response.json();: It parses the JSON response obtained from the GitHub API. The user's information is stored in the user variable.

The code extracts various user details like avatar, name, username, email, location, and the number of gists from the user object.

It then updates the user's profile table on the page with this information, including the user's avatar image.

Next, the code retrieves the user's repositories by making another API request to the URL specified in user.repos_url. It stores the repository data in the repos variable.

It populates the user's repositories in the "UserRepos" table on the web page, including the repository name and description.

If the user has more than 5 repositories, it sets the overflow and height properties to create a scrollbar for the repository table to ensure it doesn't take up too much space on the page.

If an error occurs during the API requests or if the user is not found, the code will catch the error and display an error message.

EmptyTables(): This function is defined to clear the contents of the "UserProfile" and "UserRepos" tables. It essentially clears any previous user data from the tables.
